# Task-6_Elavate_labs
Password Strength Evaluation
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how password strength is affected by length, complexity, and randomness. Multiple sample passwords were tested using online password strength checkers to evaluate their resistance against common password attacks.

The goal is to understand best practices for creating strong passwords and to document how different characteristics influence security.

🎯 Objectives

Understand what makes a password strong

Test passwords using online password strength tools

Analyze scores and feedback from the tools

Identify best practices for secure password creation

Research common password attacks

Summarize how password complexity improves security

🛠 Tools Used

Online password strength checker (e.g., PasswordMeter-style tools)

Markdown for documentation

🧪 Methodology

Created multiple passwords using:

Uppercase letters

Lowercase letters

Numbers

Symbols

Different lengths

Tested each password using a password strength checker

Recorded strength scores and feedback

Compared results to identify patterns

Researched common password attacks

Password Strength Evaluation Report

Tested passwords and character composition

Strength scores and tool feedback

Observations and analysis

Best practices and tips

Common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing)

Summary of how complexity affects security

🔐 Key Findings

Password length has the greatest impact on strength

Random passwords outperform predictable substitutions

Common words and reused passwords are highly vulnerable

Combining complexity with length greatly increases entropy

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) further strengthens security

📚 Common Password Attacks Covered

Brute Force Attacks – attempts all possible combinations

Dictionary Attacks – use common words and leaked passwords

Credential Stuffing – exploits reused credentials

✅ Best Practices Highlighted

Use passwords that are 12–16+ characters long

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid dictionary words and common patterns

Never reuse passwords across sites

Use a password manager when possible
